ðŸ”¹ 2. Budget Allocation â€“ Situation-Based Question
ðŸ“Œ The Situation (Context)
Over the past year, the marketing team at a mid-to-large enterprise launched multiple digital campaigns across various channels â€” including Social Media, Search, Influencer collaborations, Display Ads, and Email â€” targeting audiences in multiple languages and geographies.

After heavy investments across Q1â€“Q4, leadership raised concerns about whether their spend was yielding optimal returns, especially with rising CPC rates and only moderate growth in customer acquisition.

Additionally, despite reaching over 220 million impressions, conversions and profit margins seemed uneven across channels, languages, and regions.

At the same time, some internal stakeholders observed anecdotal success in specific language-targeted campaigns and during seasonal peaks (like Q2 and Q4), prompting a deeper dive into ROI tracking and revenue attribution per campaign type.

The marketing analytics team wanted to know:

Are there specific languages or regions where our marketing resonates more?

Is our cost-per-click (CPC) justifiable, and how does it vary by campaign?

Should we continue investing evenly across channels, or refocus?
